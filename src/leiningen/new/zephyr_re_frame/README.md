## Development

For development, start two servers (in separate shells), figwheel and
ring.

```shell
rlwrap lein figwheel
lein ring server
```

Notice again how the browser updates.

### Emacs/Cider

Start a repl in the context of your project with `M-x cider-jack-in`.

## Deploying to Heroku

This assumes you have a
[Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/dc), have installed the
[Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), and have done a
`heroku login` before.

``` sh
git init
git add -A
git commit
heroku create
git push heroku master:master
heroku open
```

## Running with Foreman

Heroku uses [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to run your
app, which uses the `Procfile` in your repository to figure out which
server command to run. Heroku also compiles and runs your code with a
Leiningen "production" profile, instead of "dev". To locally simulate
what Heroku does you can do:

``` sh
lein with-profile -dev,+production uberjar && foreman start
```

Now your app is running at
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in production mode.
